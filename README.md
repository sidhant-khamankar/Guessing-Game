# Guessing-Game
Made a Guessing game using python. It generates random number between 1 and 100 and user has to guess it with the help of output generated upon each guess. Getting nearer to number outputs warmer and farther from it outputs colder. Upon Success outputs number of guesses made. Used loop, modules, functions and control flow statements along with some python objects like lists.
